# ðŸ‘½ Alien Invasion
Thank to the book *Python Crash Course*, I created Alien invasion, which a clone of popular arcade game with same name.
I set a goal to read 100 pages or 5 hours per day. However, I found myself stuck at page 1100 of the book *Learning Python* by Mark Lutz, so I decided to find some projects to dig deeper in OOP. 

## ðŸš€ Introduction
> You can control the ship with LEFT, RIGHT, UP and DOWN arrow keys. You can shoot bullets with SPACE bar. By default, you have 3 lives. 
> Your highest score will be recorded in the top middle.

## ðŸ”§ Requirements
Python and PyGame

## âš” Let's play
