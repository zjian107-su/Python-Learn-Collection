# ðŸ‘½ Alien Invasion
Thank the book *Python Crash Course*, I created Alien invasion, which is a clone of a popular arcade game with the same name.
I set a goal to read 100 pages or 5 hours per day. However, I found myself stuck on page 1100 of the book *Learning Python* by Mark Lutz, so I decided to find some projects to dig deeper in OOP. 

## ðŸš€ Introduction
> You can control the ship with LEFT, RIGHT, UP, and DOWN arrow keys. You can shoot bullets with the SPACE bar. By default, you have three lives. 
> Your highest score will be recorded in the top middle.


## ðŸ”§ Requirements
Python and PyGame
